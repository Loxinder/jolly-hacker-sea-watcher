## Problem Statement
Here is a concise and targeted paragraph for your National Security Hackathon problem statement:

⸻

Maritime security forces and coastal communities in countries impacted by Chinese greyzone activities currently lack an integrated, real-time capability to detect, visualize, and respond to malign maritime activities—such as illegal fishing, automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing, misuse of maritime emergency laws, and unauthorized transshipments—conducted by foreign vessels exploiting regional vulnerabilities, particularly those flagged under convenience registries. The absence of a unified, intuitive system that combines multiple publicly available information (PAI) and commercial available information (CAI) —including AIS, radar, ELINT, and satellite imagery—limits the ability of local stakeholders to rapidly identify and mitigate threats. Additionally, low technical proficiency among regional maritime personnel and local fishermen requires solutions that offer simplified visualization, natural-language threat interpretation, and actionable, automated alerts. Building an accessible, crowdsourced platform that consolidates complex maritime data, detects anomalous vessel behavior, and communicates threats clearly and promptly can empower maritime authorities and affected communities to effectively counteract and disrupt these illicit maritime activities.
