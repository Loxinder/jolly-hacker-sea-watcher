## Ship Enrichment System

This system processes ship data through a workflow that enriches it with AIS numbers and trust scores. It exposes metrics at two points:
1. When ships are first submitted
2. After enrichment is complete

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Temporal CLI
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

The system can be started using the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start_ship_enrichment.sh

# Start all components
./start_ship_enrichment.sh start

# Stop all components
./start_ship_enrichment.sh stop

# Restart all components
./start_ship_enrichment.sh restart
```

The script will:
1. Check for prerequisites (Python 3.9+, Temporal CLI)
2. Start the Temporal server
3. Start the AIS mock server
4. Start the Temporal worker
5. Start the main server

You can press Ctrl+C to stop all components when the script is running.

### Testing the System

1. Submit a ship:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/submit_ship" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_account_id": "test-account-1",
    "timestamp": "2024-04-27T00:00:00Z",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "picture_url": "https://example.com/ship1.jpg"
  }'
```

2. Check metrics:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/metrics
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter port conflicts:
```bash
# Kill all Python processes
pkill -f python

# Kill Temporal server
pkill -f temporal
```

### Metrics Format

The system exposes two types of metrics:

1. Initial metrics (when ship is submitted):
```
ship_info{source_account_id="test-account-1",latitude="37.7749",longitude="-122.4194",stage="initial"} 1
```

2. Final metrics (after enrichment):
```
ship_trust_score{source_account_id="test-account-1",latitude="37.7749",longitude="-122.4194",ais_number="AIS-12345",stage="final",enriched="true"} 0.85
ship_ais_number_total{source_account_id="test-account-1",latitude="37.7749",longitude="-122.4194",stage="final",enriched="true"} 1
```

### Architecture

```
Client -> FastAPI (/submit_ship) -> Temporal Server -> Worker -> Activities -> Enriched Data
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                               Metrics Storage
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                               FastAPI (/metrics)
```

- The FastAPI server handles ship submissions and metrics exposure
- Temporal handles the workflow execution
- The worker processes the enrichment activities
- Metrics are stored in memory and exposed via the /metrics endpoint

## Problem Statement

Maritime security forces and coastal communities in countries impacted by Chinese greyzone activities currently lack an integrated, real-time capability to detect, visualize, and respond to malign maritime activities—such as illegal fishing, automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing, misuse of maritime emergency laws, and unauthorized transshipments—conducted by foreign vessels exploiting regional vulnerabilities, particularly those flagged under convenience registries. The absence of a unified, intuitive system that combines multiple publicly available information (PAI) and commercial available information (CAI) —including AIS, radar, ELINT, and satellite imagery—limits the ability of local stakeholders to rapidly identify and mitigate threats. Additionally, low technical proficiency among regional maritime personnel and local fishermen requires solutions that offer simplified visualization, natural-language threat interpretation, and actionable, automated alerts. Building an accessible, crowdsourced platform that consolidates complex maritime data, detects anomalous vessel behavior, and communicates threats clearly and promptly can empower maritime authorities and affected communities to effectively counteract and disrupt these illicit maritime activities.
