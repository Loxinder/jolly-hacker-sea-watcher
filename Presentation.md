## Introduction

Imagine waking up before dawn, the salty air thick with anticipation, as you prepare to set out to sea. For millions of fishermen and maritime workers around the world, the ocean is not just a livelihood—it's a way of life. But what happens when those waters, once a source of sustenance and security, become a battleground for invisible threats? When foreign vessels encroach on your shores, when international laws are bent or broken, and when the line between peace and conflict blurs into a grey zone?

The world's oceans are under unprecedented pressure—not just from overfishing or pollution, but from sophisticated, coordinated activities that challenge the very notion of sovereignty and safety at sea. The question is: how do we empower those on the front lines—maritime communities, security forces, and everyday citizens—to see, understand, and respond to these threats in real time?

We are the "Jolly Hacker" Team and we started by asking "how can technology, transparency, and collective action turn the tide in the fight for maritime security?"

## Situation
Many combatant commands (COCOMs) have attempted to combat malign maritime activities with limited success. It remains a priority which stakeholders have verified but which requires willing and capable partners to address. 

America finds itself in the competition phase in most of the world against China, who has adopted grey zone activities to subvert international laws, policies, and borders—especially in maritime activities, including illegal fishing, automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing, misuse of maritime emergency laws, and unauthorized transshipments. These actions are often conducted by foreign vessels exploiting regional vulnerabilities, particularly those flagged under convenience registries. The absence of a unified, intuitive system that combines multiple publicly available information (PAI) and commercial available information (CAI)—including AIS, radar, ELINT, and satellite imagery—limits the ability of local stakeholders to rapidly identify and mitigate threats. Additionally, low technical proficiency among regional maritime personnel and local fishermen requires solutions that offer simplified visualization, natural-language threat interpretation, and actionable, automated alerts. Building an accessible, crowdsourced platform that consolidates complex maritime data, detects anomalous vessel behavior, and communicates threats clearly and promptly can empower maritime authorities and affected communities to effectively counteract and disrupt these illicit maritime activities.

China has used economic warfare via its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) globally, which makes it difficult for countries to uphold international law of the sea when Chinese fishing vessels encroach within 12 nautical miles of a country's coastline. Transparency increases security and accountability, but the lack of real-time, integrated reporting and response tools leaves affected nations vulnerable to persistent maritime grey zone tactics.

## Solution

The solution built here is crowdsourcing the reporting of malign maritime activities and increasing the availability and transparency of these reports, while enriching reported data with known PAI/CAI sources. This approach empowers affected populations and authorities to take actions they deem appropriate, based on timely, enriched, and actionable intelligence.
